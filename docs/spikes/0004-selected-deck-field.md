# Spike 0004 — In-game "currently selected play deck" Mono field

**Goal**: find a Mono field that, while the user is on the Play screen,
holds the deck id of the deck the user has clicked on (the deck about
to be queued). Outcome decides whether `add-deck-tracker-mvp`'s
`InGameDeckIdentifier` ships with auto-detection from memory or stays
dialog-only.

**Spike date**: 2026-04-22 (HDT.js iteration session)

## Method

Used existing diagnostic CLIs against a running Hearthstone process:

1. `cargo run --example diag_images -- "<class>"` — find a candidate
   class.
2. `cargo run --example diag_klass_fields -- 0x<klass>` — dump field
   names + offsets.
3. `cargo run --example diag_static_chain -- 0x<klass> s_instance ...` —
   verify the reachable chain.

## Findings

### Candidates probed

| Class                                | Verdict | Reason                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CollectionManager`                  | ❌      | No `m_lastSelectedDeck` / `m_currentDeckId` / similar; only `m_EditedDeck`. |
| `DeckPickerTrayDisplay`              | ✅      | Has `s_instance` + `m_selectedCustomDeckBox` + `m_visualsFormatType`.      |
| `DeckPickerState`                    | ❌      | Class doesn't exist (it's HearthMirror's DTO name, not a game class).      |

### Confirmed chain

```
DeckPickerTrayDisplay.s_instance       (Assembly-CSharp.dll, MonoBehaviour singleton)
  ├─ m_visualsFormatType : i32           ← current format tab (Wild/Standard/Classic/Twist)
  └─ m_selectedCustomDeckBox             (CollectionDeckBox UI component)
       ├─ m_deckID         : i64         ← THIS is the saved-deck id we want
       └─ m_deckTemplateId : i32         ← > 0 for Blizzard template (PvP starter / event) decks
```

Cross-referenced against upstream HearthMirror's
`HearthMirror.decompiled.cs:2549` (`InternalGetDeckPickerState`)
which reads exactly the same fields.

### Lifecycle constraint

`DeckPickerTrayDisplay.s_instance` is **null until the user opens the
Play menu's deck-picker scene**. In main menu / collection / settings /
mid-match the class hasn't been instantiated and `runtime_info` is
NULL — `MonoRuntime::get_singleton` returns `Ok(None)`, the reflector
returns `null`, the orchestrator falls back to `CallbackDeckIdentifier`
(dialog flow).

This matches upstream behaviour and is the correct degraded path:
the dialog covers Practice / Brawl / Adventure / Tavern Brawl modes
where the deck picker UI never loads to begin with.

### Validity by mode

Based on the same upstream code path:

| Mode                       | `s_instance` available? | Deck id readable?                       |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Standard / Wild Ranked     | ✅                       | ✅ (`m_deckID > 0`)                      |
| Standard / Wild Casual     | ✅                       | ✅ (`m_deckID > 0`)                      |
| Friendly Challenge         | ✅                       | ✅ (`m_deckID > 0`)                      |
| Tavern Brawl (custom deck) | ✅                       | ✅ (`m_deckID > 0`)                      |
| Tavern Brawl (template)    | ✅                       | template-only (`m_deckTemplateId > 0`)   |
| Practice (Innkeeper)       | ❌ (different scene)     | n/a — dialog fallback                    |
| Adventure / Solo Content   | ❌ (different scene)     | n/a — dialog fallback                    |
| Battlegrounds / Mercs      | ❌ (different scene)     | out-of-scope per M2 non-goals            |

## Outcome

Reflector implemented as `getSelectedDeckId` →
`Promise<{ deckId: bigint, templateDeckId: number, formatType: number } | null>`.
`@hdt/core`'s `InGameDeckIdentifier` now consumes it: matches `deckId`
against `getDecks()` results, returns the matching saved deck or
`null` (which triggers the dialog fallback).

## Live-validation status (2026-04-22)

- ✅ Verified `s_instance` == NULL when on main menu (correct
  degraded state).
- ✅ Verified end-to-end on Play screen with "龙德" highlighted:

  ```
  selected: deckId=9369585848 templateDeckId=0 formatType=2
  ★ id=9369585848  name="龙德"  hero=HERO_06bb  fmt=2  cards=30
  → MATCH: deckId 9369585848 = "龙德"
     first 5 cards: CORE_EX1_169 x2, TIME_701 x2, EDR_270 x2,
                    END_011 x2, END_007 x2
  ```

  `getSelectedDeckId` returns the live highlighted deck id,
  cross-references cleanly against `getDecks`, and resolves to the
  matching saved-deck name in one round-trip. `InGameDeckIdentifier`
  in `@hdt/core` consumes this exact path and now resolves the
  active deck without dialog interaction in standard PvP queue
  flows.

  Validation tool: `cargo run --release --target i686-pc-windows-msvc
  --example diag_match_selected_deck` (committed alongside).
