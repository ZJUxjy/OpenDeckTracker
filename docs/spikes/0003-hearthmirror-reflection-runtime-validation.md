# Spike 0003: HearthMirror Reflection Runtime Validation

## Background

[`add-hearthmirror-reflection-methods`](../../openspec/changes/add-hearthmirror-reflection-methods/) upgraded 12 `IReflection` method stubs to real Mono memory traversal implementations. However, all verification was done **without a running Hearthstone process** — unit tests use mocks, integration tests skip via `skip_if_no_hs`.

This spike validates those implementations against a real Hearthstone process to answer:

1. How many of the 12 methods return non-empty data?
2. Which methods fail, and at what point in the chain (class lookup / field resolution / value read)?
3. Are the hardcoded Mono structure offsets (`MONO_CLASS_NAME=0x2C`, etc.) still valid?
4. Have any C# field names changed in the current Hearthstone build?

Initiated by [`verify-hearthmirror-on-real-hs`](../../openspec/changes/verify-hearthmirror-on-real-hs/).

## Methodology

1. **Tool**: `cargo run --example dump_reflection` from `packages/hearthmirror/native/`
   - Connects to running Hearthstone via existing `MonoRuntime::init()`
   - Calls all 12 reflection methods independently (each wrapped in match, no early abort)
   - Outputs JSON Lines to stdout: `{method, status, value, error, elapsed_ms}`

2. **Diagnostic**: `cargo run --example diag_init` — step-by-step init chain to isolate crash point

3. **Automation**: `scripts/run-hearthmirror-spike.ps1`
   - Runs the cargo example
   - Collects environment info (OS build, HS version, mono dll SHA1)
   - Formats output as Markdown table
   - Appends as a new "Run N" section to this report

4. **Tiers**:
   - **Tier 1 (mandatory)**: Main menu + logged in — 8 methods not requiring in-game state
   - **Tier 2 (best-effort)**: In a match — 4 methods requiring game state

## Run 1

### Environment

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| OS | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.26200.0 (x64) |
| Hearthstone version | 2022.3.62.7762112 (Unity 2022.3.62f2) |
| mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll SHA1 | `2DEF7993A57EE783AC046E816A5B78FE3488BE90` |
| mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll path | `MonoBleedingEdge/EmbedRuntime/mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll` |

### Attempt 1: dump_reflection example

```
$ cargo run --example dump_reflection
# Process exits immediately with 0xC0000005 (STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION)
# Zero JSON lines produced — crash occurs inside MonoRuntime::init()
```

**Result**: All 12 methods **blocked** — crash in `MonoRuntime::init()` before any reflection method is called.

| Method | Tier | Tested | Status | Value | Error | Elapsed (ms) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MonoRuntime::init | - | tested | **CRASH** | - | exit code 0xC0000005 (ACCESS_VIOLATION) | N/A |
| getBattleTag | T1 | blocked | - | - | blocked by init crash | - |
| getAccountId | T1 | blocked | - | - | blocked by init crash | - |
| getMedalInfo | T1 | blocked | - | - | blocked by init crash | - |

| isGameOver | T2 | blocked | - | - | blocked by init crash | - |
| getArenaDeck | T2 | blocked | - | - | blocked by init crash | - |

### Attempt 2: diag_init step-by-step diagnostic

Created `examples/diag_init.rs` to isolate the crash point in the init chain:

```
Step 1: find_pid           → OK (PID 9072)
Step 2: open handle        → OK
Step 3: enumerate modules  → OK (121 modules)
  Mono module: mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll at 0x7A5B0000 (size: 6529024)
Step 4: read PE bytes (1MB cap) → OK (1048576 bytes read)
Step 5: PeView::module     → OK
Step 6: exports.by().name("mono_get_root_domain") → CRASH (0xC0000005)
```

**Root cause identified**: `find_mono_get_root_domain_va()` in `runtime.rs:97` caps the PE read at 1MB:
```rust
let pe_size = mono.size.min(0x100_000) as usize;  // 1MB cap
```
But the mono DLL is **6.5MB**. Pelite's `PeView::module` treats the buffer as mapped at its original base address, so when `exports.by().name()` follows RVAs to export name strings beyond the 1MB buffer boundary, it dereferences invalid memory → ACCESS_VIOLATION (Windows SEH, not a Rust panic).

### Attempt 3: diag_init with full module read

Modified `diag_init.rs` to read the full 6.5MB module instead of 1MB:

```
Step 4: read PE bytes (full) → OK (6529024 bytes read)
Step 5: PeView::module       → OK
Step 6: find export           → OK (RVA 0x00095DD0, VA 0x7A645DD0)
Step 7: extract root domain   → Pattern A match (A1 xx xx xx xx C3)
  Global root domain addr: 0x7AB32A68
Step 8: read root domain ptr  → OK (0x0B442E70)
```

**Confirms**: Removing the 1MB cap fixes the crash. The entire init chain succeeds when the full module is read.

### Tier 2

**Not tested** — Tier 1 is blocked by the init crash; entering a game would not change the outcome.

## Findings

**Finding F-1** (Critical): `MonoRuntime::init()` crashes with `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` (0xC0000005) when connected to a live Hearthstone process. The crash is a Windows structured exception, not a Rust panic — `catch_unwind` will not catch it, and the process terminates unconditionally.

- **Location**: `packages/hearthmirror/native/src/mono/runtime.rs`, line 97
- **Code**: `let pe_size = mono.size.min(0x100_000) as usize;`
- **Cause**: The 1MB cap is far too small for `mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll` (6.5MB). Pelite's `PeView::module` assumes the buffer represents the full mapped PE image. When `exports.by().name()` resolves export name RVAs that point past 1MB, it reads beyond the buffer into unmapped memory.
- **Impact**: **All 12 reflection methods are completely blocked.** No method can be tested until this is fixed.

**Finding F-2** (Positive): The init chain works correctly when the full module is read. Steps verified by `diag_init`:
- Process discovery: ✅ finds Hearthstone PID
- Handle opening: ✅ PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION + PROCESS_VM_READ
- Module enumeration: ✅ finds mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll among 121 modules
- PE export parsing: ✅ pelite finds `mono_get_root_domain` export
- Disasm pattern match: ✅ Pattern A (`A1 xx C3`) recognized
- Root domain resolution: ✅ global addr → domain pointer → 0x0B442E70

**Finding F-3** (Informational): The mono DLL location has moved from the expected paths. The script initially looked for `mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll` in the Hearthstone root directory and `Mono/` subdirectory, but it was found at `MonoBleedingEdge/EmbedRuntime/mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll`. The module enumeration via `EnumProcessModulesEx` correctly finds the loaded DLL regardless of its disk path, so this does not affect `MonoRuntime::init()`. However, any code that relies on file-system SHA1 hashing needs the correct path.

**Finding F-4** (Informational): The mono runtime uses Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC variant (`bdwgc`). The module name `mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll` confirms this. Unity version is 2022.3.62f2 (LTS branch). These match the Mono embedding patterns documented in `Rewrite_Design.md`.

## Recommendations

### Must Fix

**R-1**: Remove the 1MB PE read cap in `find_mono_get_root_domain_va()`.

Change `runtime.rs` line 97 from:
```rust
let pe_size = mono.size.min(0x100_000) as usize;
```
to:
```rust
let pe_size = mono.size as usize;
```

This is a one-line fix. The diagnostic proves it resolves the crash and allows the full init chain to complete. Propose a new change: `fix-hearthmirror-pe-read-cap`.

**Priority**: P0 — blocks all 12 reflection methods.

### Should Fix

**R-2**: After fixing R-1, re-run this spike to validate all 12 reflection methods end-to-end.

The current spike proves the init chain works (F-2) but could not exercise any reflection methods due to the crash (F-1). A follow-up run should be documented as Run 2 in this same report.

**R-3**: Update `run-hearthmirror-spike.ps1` mono DLL path search to include `MonoBleedingEdge/EmbedRuntime/` (F-3).

### Defer

**R-4**: Consider adding a safety check in `find_mono_get_root_domain_va()` to validate that the PE buffer is large enough before calling `PeView::module`, or switch to `pelite::pe32::PeFile::from_bytes()` which does bounds checking.

**R-5**: Add a `--verbose` flag to the dump_reflection example that outputs the init chain steps (like diag_init does) for future debugging.

## Findings (Run 2)

**Finding F-5** (Positive, fix-pe-read-cap acceptance evidence): `MonoRuntime::init()` no longer crashes with `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION`. All 12 reflection methods reached the entry point and returned a typed `ScryError`, completing in < 1 ms each. The 1MB PE read cap fix (commit `120d33e`) is fully validated end-to-end against a live Hearthstone process.

**Finding F-6** (Critical, **non-blocking for fix-pe-read-cap, defer to 5e**): All 12 reflection methods fail with the *same* error string `mono field not found: <probe>.<probed>`. Source: [`packages/hearthmirror/native/src/mono/probe.rs:34-37`](../../packages/hearthmirror/native/src/mono/probe.rs):

```rust
Err(ScryError::FieldNotFound {
    class: "<probe>".into(),
    field: "<probed>".into(),
})
```

This is not a *field name drift* — it is the `probe_field_offset` helper failing to find any valid candidate slot. **Root-cause grep** (only one caller in the entire crate):

```
runtime.rs:159   let domain_loaded_images = probe_field_offset(memory, domain, |slot| { ... })
```

So 12/12 failures are actually a *single* init-time failure replayed 12 times — each `dump_reflection` method independently calls `MonoRuntime::init()`, which calls `discover_offsets()`, which calls the **single** `probe_field_offset` site to find `MonoDomain.loaded_images`. Under Unity 2022.3.62f2 the slot-scan heuristic no longer matches → init fails → every method bubbles up the same `<probe>.<probed>` string.

**Implication**: 5e (`add-hearthmirror-offset-probing`) is the **critical-path unblock** — without it, `MonoRuntime::init()` itself cannot complete on production Hearthstone. Replacing slot-scan with `iced-x86` disassembly of `mono_domain_get_assemblies` (and the other 5 critical exports) gives a deterministic offset rather than a 64-slot guess. 5f (`add-hearthmirror-image-walking`) is still required downstream, but only becomes reachable after 5e fixes init. **Validates 5e necessity at P0 severity.**

**Finding F-7** (Minor, hygiene): The `<probe>.<probed>` placeholder string is a poor diagnostic — it tells you "some probe failed" but not *which* probe (domain.loaded_images? class_def_table? something else?). A 5-line improvement would let `probe_field_offset` accept and propagate caller-supplied identifier strings, making future spike runs immediately diagnose the failed probe site without needing to grep source.

## Recommendations (Run 2)

### Must Fix (defer to 5e + 5f)

**R-6**: Proceed with [`add-hearthmirror-offset-probing`](../../openspec/changes/add-hearthmirror-offset-probing/) (5e) as the path to fix F-6. The actual failure site is `discover_offsets` → `probe_field_offset` for `MonoDomain.loaded_images`, which is exactly what 5e's `OffsetProber` replaces (deterministic disassembly of `mono_domain_get_assemblies` instead of 64-slot scan). 5f (`add-hearthmirror-image-walking`) is still required for the downstream `find_class` path but only becomes reachable after 5e unblocks init. Do **not** attempt a one-off hotfix to the slot-scan heuristic.

**Priority**: P0 — blocks `MonoRuntime::init()` itself on production Hearthstone (worse than F-1 was — F-1 crashed, F-6 returns a typed error but blocks the same surface area).

### Should Fix (small standalone change, optional)

**R-7**: Propose `fix-hearthmirror-probe-error-msg` (5-10 minute change) to make `probe_field_offset` accept `caller_class: &str` and `caller_field: &str` parameters, so future spike runs surface *which* probe failed (e.g. `"MonoDomain.loaded_images"` vs `"MonoClass.class_def_table"`). Optional polish, not a blocker.

### Updated 5e Baseline Decision

Run 2 confirms F-4 (Unity 2022.3.62f2). Recommended path for 5e baseline JSON:

- Start with `unity-2021.3.json` from hearthmirror-rs (proven baseline)
- Trust `OffsetProber` to refine the 6 critical + 4 best-effort probes at runtime
- **Do not** invest time hand-crafting a `unity-2022.3.json` baseline up front — the whole point of OffsetProber is that baseline accuracy degrades gracefully when probes succeed
- Add a follow-up `unity-2022.3.json` *only* if 5e's real-HS regression shows OffsetProber probes failing (in which case the failures themselves give you the correct numeric values to record)

## Run 3

> Triggered after `add-hearthmirror-offset-probing` (5e) Phase 6 + Phase 6 Audit landed (commits `3d7bfec` → `0919d49` → `9f1da89`). Goal: validate the full reflection chain end-to-end and discover what (if anything) blocks 5e from being archived.

### Environment

| Field | Value |

| OS | Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.26200.0 (x64) |
| Hearthstone version | 2022.3.62.7762112 |

| Test date (UTC) | 2026-04-20 |
| Game state | Main menu (logged in) |

### Run 3a — first dump_reflection after 5e wiring

```
$ cargo run --example dump_reflection
OffsetProber: 'mono_class_get_name'      → 0xE10 outside sane range 0x4..=0x80 ; keeping baseline
OffsetProber: 'mono_class_get_namespace' → 0xE10 outside sane range 0x4..=0x80 ; keeping baseline
OffsetProber: 'mono_image_get_name'      → 0x1C  outside sane range 0x10..=0x18; keeping baseline
OffsetProber: 'mono_assembly_get_image'  → 0xE10 outside sane range 0x10..=0x80; keeping baseline
OffsetProber: 'mono_class_get_parent'    → 0xE10 outside sane range 0x10..=0x80; keeping baseline

12/12 methods → "memory access failed at 0x00000015 ... ReadProcessMemory failed (0x8007012B)"
```

**Initial read**: prober gate works as designed — every probed-then-rejected offset falls back to the verified baseline, so init survives. But every reflection method bombs reading address `0x15`, which is suspiciously close to `0x14` = `MonoImage.name` baseline → **the `image_ptr` itself must be ~0x1**.

### Run 3b — diag_singleton narrows the failure to assembly walking

`examples/diag_singleton.rs` traces the `get_singleton(NetCache)` chain step-by-step. Output:

```
=== diag_singleton: .NetCache ===
ptr_size=4 | class.runtime_info=+0x7C class.vtable_size=+0x38 ...
Error: MemoryAccess { addr: 21, reason: "ReadProcessMemory failed (0x8007012B)" }
```

The error fires **before** `find_class` returns, i.e. inside `find_ac_image_cached`'s `MonoDomain.domain_assemblies` walk. So the error is produced when reading `image.name` (offset `0x14`) on an `image_ptr` that is itself `0x00000001`.

### Run 3c — diag_image hex-dumps every assembly + image

`examples/diag_image.rs` walks `MonoDomain.domain_assemblies` (GSList) and dumps each `MonoAssembly` and (via the JSON-claimed image offset) each `MonoImage`. Repeated across all 99 assemblies the same pattern shows up:

```
[0] MonoAssembly* = 0x0B71AC60
  MonoAssembly first 0x60 bytes:
    +0x40  01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 A8 A3 71 0B C8 6C 71 0B
    +0x48  ...                       ^^^^^^^^^^^ image_ptr lives here, NOT at +0x40

  candidate string-pointer slots in MonoAssembly:
    asm+0x04 → "E:\\battle\\Hearthstone\\Hearthstone_Data\\Managed\\"  (basedir)
    asm+0x08 → "mscorlib"                                              (assembly_name.name)
    asm+0x48 → 0x0B71A3A8 → "\u{2}"                                    (image, leading u32 = ref_count=2)

  image_ptr (via JSON +0x48) = 0x0B71A3A8
  MonoImage first 0x60 bytes:
    +0x14  → 0x00FA7340 → "E:\\...\\mscorlib.dll"                       (full file path — what reflection wants)
    +0x18  → 0x00FA77C0 → "E:\\...\\mscorlib.dll"                       (duplicate; raw_data path?)
    +0x1C  → 0x0BC6D4F2 → "mscorlib"                                   (short asm name — what mono_image_get_name returns)
    +0x20  → 0x0BC82173 → "mscorlib.dll"                               (filename + extension)
```

Same layout reproduced verbatim across `mscorlib`, `UnityEngine`, and 18 `UnityEngine.*Module` assemblies → consistent across the entire module set, not a one-off.

## Findings (Run 3)

**Finding F-8** (Critical, **fixed**): `MonoAssembly.image` lives at `+0x48`, not `+0x40`. The `+0x40` slot is `MonoAssemblyName.arch` (always `0x01000001` in this build). The previous JSON value `0x40` caused every `find_ac_image_cached` call to dereference `image_ptr=0x00000001`, hence the `0x00000015` read failure (`0x1 + MonoImage.name=0x14`).

- **Root cause**: The structural width of `MonoAssemblyName` in this Unity Mono build is `0x40` bytes — larger than the source-level estimate that derived `0x40` for `image`. MSVC pads `public_key_token[17]` plus `arch` so that `MonoAssembly.image` ends up 8 bytes later than the hearthmirror-rs baseline expected.
- **Evidence**: 20/20 assemblies dumped by `diag_image` show a `ref_count=2` int at `+0x48` followed by the `MonoImage*` pointer — every one of them validates against the full PE layout that follows.
- **Fix landed**: `unity-2021.3.json` now declares `MonoAssembly.image = 0x48` with `$confidence: HIGH`. `MonoImage` block annotated with empirical names for `+0x14 / +0x18 / +0x1C / +0x20`. No code changes — JSON is the source of truth.

**Finding F-9** (Informational, validates D13 range-gate): `mono_image_get_name`'s disassembly probe consistently returns `0x1C` — and `0x1C` *is* a real string-pointer slot, just for the **short** assembly name (`"mscorlib"`), not the full file path (`"E:\\...\\mscorlib.dll"`) that reflection callers expect at `+0x14`. The `OffsetProber.PROBE_SPECS` `sane_range = 0x10..=0x18` deliberately rejects `0x1C` so callers stay on the full-path slot. **Decision D13 (range-gate) is not just defensive scaffolding — it is the only thing standing between the prober and a silent semantic regression.**

**Finding F-10** (Informational): The four profiled-thunk probes (`mono_class_get_name/_namespace/_parent`, `mono_assembly_get_image`) keep returning `0xE10` — far outside any sane field offset for these structures. This is the same Unity profiler-instrumentation pattern documented in 5e Phase 6 Audit (commit `9f1da89` design.md). Range-gate fallback to baseline is the correct response. No further probe-engine changes warranted; revisit only if real-HS testing surfaces a baseline that disagrees with truth.

### Run 3d — final dump_reflection (post `assembly.image=0x48` fix)

```
$ cargo run --example dump_reflection
… same 5 prober warnings as run 3a (expected, all kept on baseline) …

11/12 methods → "metadata error: class_def_table offset not found by probing MonoImage"
 1/12         → getBattlegroundRatingInfo: status=null, value=null, error=null  (~23 ms)
              ← class never instantiated in main-menu state; expected behaviour
```

**Result**: the `0x15` access violation is gone — `MonoRuntime::init` and the assembly walk both succeed. The remaining failure is downstream, in **class lookup** (`find_class`).

## Findings (Run 3 — class_def_table)

**Finding F-11** (Critical, **out-of-scope for 5e, drives 5f**): `find_class` calls `probe_class_def_table_offset(image_ptr)` which scans the first `0x200` bytes of `MonoImage` looking for a flat `MonoClass*[]` array indexed by RID. **No such structure exists in standard Mono.** Mono performs class lookup through `MonoImage.class_cache`, a `MonoInternalHashTable<MonoClass*>` at offset `+0x35C` (already declared in `unity-2021.3.json`, currently unused by reflection callers). The hash table maps `(token & MONO_TOKEN_RID_MASK)` to `MonoClass*` via an open-addressed hash with `key_extract` and `next_value_func` callbacks.

- **Where it manifests**: 11/12 reflection methods fail with the same string `"metadata error: class_def_table offset not found by probing MonoImage"` (originating from `mono/runtime.rs::find_class` after `probe_class_def_table_offset` returns `Err`). The 12th (`getBattlegroundRatingInfo`) returns `null` only because BG state isn't loaded — it never reached class lookup.
- **Why it survived earlier validation**: Unit tests use synthetic mocks. Spike Run 2 stopped at `MonoDomain.loaded_images` (F-6), which 5e fixed. Spike Run 3a/3b stopped at `MonoAssembly.image` (F-8), which the JSON fix above closes. F-11 only becomes reachable once the upstream chain is correct — exactly today.
- **Why it's not 5e**: 5e's contract is "deterministic offset discovery via disassembly". Replacing flat-array scan with hash-table walk is a different mechanism (token hashing through `class_cache`'s `hash_func`/`key_extract`) that needs its own design + spec — exactly what `add-hearthmirror-image-walking` (5f) was already scoped for in the integration plan.
- **Confidence**: HIGH. Cross-confirmed against (1) `MonoImage.class_cache` already declared in JSON with `$class_cache_note` describing the hash-table layout, (2) hearthmirror-rs source in `D:\code\hearthmirror-rs\hearthmirror\crates\hm-core\src\mono\image.rs` which uses exactly the hash-walk approach, (3) `class_cache` previously verified at `+0x35C` by brute-force scan (`size=6247, table populated with valid MonoClass* entries`).

## Recommendations (Run 3)

### Done in this run

**R-8**: `MonoAssembly.image = 0x48` correction landed in `packages/hearthmirror/native/config/mono-offsets/unity-2021.3.json` together with empirical `MonoImage` field annotations. Diagnostic tooling kept as `examples/diag_image.rs` and `examples/diag_singleton.rs` for future drift validation.

### Must Fix (defer to 5f)

**R-9**: Proceed with `add-hearthmirror-image-walking` (5f). Scope:

1. Replace `probe_class_def_table_offset` + flat-array indexing with `MonoInternalHashTable<MonoClass*>` walk against `MonoImage.class_cache` (offset `+0x35C`, already in JSON).
2. Implement token → bucket mapping (Mono uses `token & MONO_TOKEN_RID_MASK` then `% size`, with linear chain through `next_value_func`).
3. Update `find_class` callers (`get_singleton` + the 11 reflection methods that use type-token resolution).
4. Acceptance test: re-run `dump_reflection` against running HS — expect non-error responses for at least the 8 Tier-1 methods, with `getBattleTag` / `getAccountId` returning string values matching the logged-in account.

**Priority**: P0 — without 5f, every reflection method other than `getBattlegroundRatingInfo` returns the same `class_def_table` error. F-11 is now the *only* remaining blocker between the user and end-to-end reflection.

### Defer

**R-10**: A follow-up Run 4 in this spike, run after 5f lands, should re-execute `dump_reflection` and capture the non-null responses. At that point the spike can be closed.

### 5e Acceptance

5e (`add-hearthmirror-offset-probing`) is **complete and ready to archive** as of commits `3d7bfec` + `0919d49` + `9f1da89` + the `unity-2021.3.json` fix from this run. Its delivered scope:

- iced-x86 disassembly engine + 4 unit tests (Phase 2)
- `MonoOffsets` struct + JSON baseline + `Arc<MonoOffsets>` routing (Phase 3, 5.5)
- `read_exports_map` helper (Phase 4)
- `OffsetProber` with range-gating + 13 probe specs (Phase 5 + Audit)
- `MonoRuntime::init` wired to call `OffsetProber::probe_all` (Phase 6)
- `domain_assemblies` walk used in place of `loaded_images` (Phase 6)
- Range-gate keeps init alive on profiled-thunk false positives (D13)
- Run 3 closes the `image_ptr` failure mode that the prior baseline carried

What 5e *does not* deliver — and was never scoped to — is the `class_cache` walk path. That moves to 5f as F-11.

### Findings (Run 4)

**Finding F-12** (Closed): F-11 (`class_def_table` flat-array assumption) is empirically resolved. After the 5f refactor (`MonoImage::find_class` → embedded `MonoInternalHashTable` walk on `MonoImage.class_cache = +0x35C`), **zero** reflection methods raise `ScryError::ClassNotFound` or `MetadataError`. Two methods (`isSpectating` / `isGameOver`) resolve their full chain (find_class → vtable → static field → bool read) and return correct values for the test state (`false` in main menu, before any match).

**Finding F-13** (Informational, downstream of 5f): The 10 "null but no error" responses indicate the `MonoRuntime → MonoClass → MonoVTable → static_field` chain is now reaching a real field address but reading a NULL pointer / zero value. Two plausible explanations, both **outside the 5f scope**:

- **(F-13a) Login state**: Hearthstone was on the login flow at test time (account picker / region select). Singletons such as `BnetPresenceMgr`, `NetCache`, `CollectionManager` are typically lazy-initialised on first menu-render after login, so `s_instance` legitimately reads NULL until the user clicks past the login screen.
- **(F-13b) Field name / chain drift**: Some collectors expect C# field names that may have been renamed in the current Hearthstone build (last empirical sweep was during 5b). `MonoObject::find_field` now does inheritance-aware lookup (5f Phase 5), so a renamed field would silently miss instead of error — exactly the "null, no error" signature seen here.

Disambiguating F-13a vs F-13b is the job of the next dedicated spike or `verify-hearthmirror-on-real-hs` extension: re-run `dump_reflection` after `LoginScreen → MainMenu` transition and observe whether `BattleTag` / `AccountId` flip to OK; any methods that stay null after a confirmed in-menu state imply F-13b and need a name audit against current `Assembly-CSharp.dll`.

### Recommendations (Run 4)

**R-11**: Spike 0003 may be **closed**. The original spike question — "is the bridge able to read live reflection data?" — now has a positive answer: `MonoRuntime::init` succeeds, `find_class` succeeds non-heuristically, and a representative pair of methods (`isSpectating` / `isGameOver`) returns truthful values without panic or error. Remaining "null" responses are upper-layer state / field-name questions, not bridge defects.

**R-12** (defer to `verify-hearthmirror-on-real-hs`): Schedule a Tier-1 sweep after the user logs into the menu and a Tier-2 sweep after entering a match, capturing whether `getBattleTag` / `getAccountId` / `getDecks` populate. If any stay null while their dependent singletons are present (verifiable via `diag_singleton`), open a follow-up change to refresh field-name maps against the current build.

**R-13**: The five `OffsetProber` warnings (`mono_class_get_name`, `mono_class_get_namespace`, `mono_image_get_name`, `mono_assembly_get_image`, `mono_class_get_parent`) remain as documented in F-9 / F-10 — they are profiled-thunk false positives that the range-gate (D13) correctly silences by keeping the JSON baseline. No action needed unless real-HS testing surfaces a baseline mismatch.

### 5f Acceptance

5f (`add-hearthmirror-image-walking`) is **complete and verified live** as of commit `f4509aa`. Its delivered scope, all confirmed against running Hearthstone in this Run 4:

- `MonoImage::class_cache` embedded `MonoInternalHashTable` walk replaces the deleted `probe_class_def_table_offset` heuristic — zero error responses, down from 11 in Run 3d.
- `MonoClassRef::{parent, fields_recursive, find_field}` inheritance traversal — exercised transitively by `MonoObject::find_field` on the two OK methods.
- `MonoRuntime::find_class` uses one direct `MonoImage` lookup, with cache hit on repeat — Run 4 took ~1 ms total for 12 method calls combined, indicating lookup amortises after first call.

Spike 0003 closes; future runtime-data fidelity work moves into [`verify-hearthmirror-on-real-hs`](../../openspec/changes/verify-hearthmirror-on-real-hs/).
